# Command Handlers for Discord.JS
All of the command handlers listed here have support for **v12**.

> With v13 coming around the corner, this file will change over the course of time. ⏰

## Simply-Discord
The simplest pre-made command handler, which has minimal features but it's enough for an average discord.js developer.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/simply-discord

## AeroClient
A pretty big command handler with a lot of customization, it's enough for a developer to understand and use this handler to it's full potiental.

https://npmjs.com/package/@aeroware/aeroclient

## CDCommands
One of the most advanced command handlers, with a lot of customization. It requires MongoDB, and a deep grasp of Discord.JS

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdcommands

## Bot-Prefab
This is personally one of the best **non** package command handlers, since it has language support, and built-in schemas for all of the users and guilds. It's a very great prefab for setting up discord bots on the go!

## Slashcord
One of the best slash command handlers, this is very useful for **v12** of Discord.JS since it didn't have slash command support at the time.
> With v13 around the corner, this package will come of the list considering how v13 will have all the necessary features that are already in this package. 📦

https://www.npmjs.com/package/slashcord

## WOKCommands

This handler is a bit of a mix-up, it's considered good and bad to people, but it's great for new comers to Discord.JS for setting up on the go bots!

https://www.npmjs.com/package/wokcommands
